 * browser. This poller is the client's way of learning, without a manual
 * refresh, WHEN the server says the run has finished: while an acquisition is
 * in flight it re-fetches the server view on an interval, and the moment the
 * server stops reporting an active run the parent stops rendering this poller
 * (its effect cleanup clears the timer) and the buttons/placeholder release.
 *
 * Mount it ONLY when the server reports work in flight.
